Shares of Zillow Group fell 17% on Wednesday, pacing for their worst day since Nov.\nContent:\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on February 09, 2026 in New York City.\n\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images\n\nThe [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) slipped on Wednesday and snapped a three-day win streak after the better-than-expected [January jobs report](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html) failed to spark a sustainable advance.\n\nThe blue-chip index lost 66.74 points, or 0.13%, and closed at 50,121.40. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) inched down less than a point to 6,941.47. The [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) dropped 0.16% to end at 23,066.47.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' January nonfarm payrolls report — which had been delayed due to a partial government shutdown that [ended on Feb. 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/house-republicans-reopen-us-government-shutdown.html) — showed job growth of 130,000 last month. Economists polled by Dow Jones had called for a gain of 55,000. The latest figure also marked a sizable increase from December, which was downwardly revised to 48,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate also landed at 4.3%, a bit below the Dow Jones forecast for 4.4%.\n\nWhile the report showed the strongest job gains in more than a year, areas of growth remained concentrated in just a few sectors, predominantly health care-related, which added 124,000 total positions. That was double the normal growth from 2025. Moreover, there is the continuing specter of downward revisions over the labor market, particularly after every month in 2025 saw adjustments lower. With benchmark annual revisions combined with monthly moves through the year, average monthly job growth last year was just 15,000.\n\n\"This is generally a good sign, as you'd expect, but we are certainly not out of the woods yet with respect to the labor market. 'Moving in the right direction' would be a better description. The unemployment rate is gradually improving, but there are still plenty of signs that the labor market remains exceedingly weak,\" Rick Wedell, CIO at RFG Advisory, said, citing a low quit rate as one example.\n\n\"In this environment, it is clear that we still have a long way to go before the labor market can be considered 'solid,'\" he added.\n\n[Treasury yields had initially jumped](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/us-treasury-yields-investors-await-delayed-january-jobs-report.html) on the heels of the report as it at first fueled investor optimism that the economy was on firm footing. At session highs, the Dow was up more than 300 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.9%. However, odds for interest rate cuts from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/) were reduced, which could have thrown a wrench into that enthusiasm.\n\nThe jobs report follows weaker-than-expected consumer data released on Tuesday. That report showed that [consumer spending in December was flat](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html), missing the 0.4% monthly gain expected from economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\n\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. \"The Fed will take this point into its calculus when it makes its decision next month on whether to hold rates steady. With its wait-and-see data dependent stance, this will surely put the balance towards a hold.\"\n\nSoftware stocks, which were a [key driver of last week's rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/is-the-ai-bubble-popping-itself-software-rout-raises-concerns.html) amid [fears of disruption from artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/ai-anthropic-tools-saas-software-stocks-selloff.html), came under pressure yet again Tuesday. [Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/) was down 4%, while [ServiceNow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOW/) fell 5%. The [iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IGV/) dropped more than 2%, putting it nearly 30% below its 52-week high.

Shares of digital infrastructure provider [Vertiv](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) surged 24% after the company posted a fourth-quarter earnings beat and issued a strong 2026 outlook.

[McDonald's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/) turned positive after an earnings beat.\n\nThose moves come after a downbeat trading day on Wall Street, with the 30-stock [Dow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) off by more than 66 points, or 0.1%, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) dipped about 0.2%. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) ended the day just a tick lower.\n\nStocks ended the session lower after earlier rallying off the back of a strong jobs report. The [January nonfarm payrolls report](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html) showed sharp jobs growth of 130,000 last month, far above what economists were expecting, and much higher than the downwardly revised December gain. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 4.3% from 4.4%.\n\nThe report was a relief for investors who worried it would show a drop-off in the labor market, following a [raft of recent data](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/a-weakening-labor-market-has-become-the-economys-biggest-threat.html) that's indicated slowing growth in a \"no hire, no fire\" environment.\n\nYet the strong payrolls numbers [also muddy](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/the-jobs-picture-still-looks-muddy-even-with-surprisingly-strong-january-growth.html) the Federal Reserve's interest rate outlook, and could mean fewer rate cuts than traders were hoping for if higher inflation also remains an issue. That underscores the importance of Friday's consumer price index, which could show the central bank just what is needed for its dual mandate to come into better balance.\n\n\"It's going to put a lot of weight on Friday's CPI report, because if that comes in tame, at least the market can understand that the inflation part of the Fed's equation is cooling,\" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \"[Closing Bell](https://www.cnbc.com/closing-bell/)\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"And of course, now, if the job market is showing decent strength, it kind of relieves us from a macro perspective, because at least we're not seeing an economic downturn,\" Lee continued.\n\n6 Min Ago\n\n## JPMorgan downgrades Kraft Heinz\n\nJPMorgan says that persistent challenges will weigh down shares of [Kraft Heinz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KHC/) as the company backs away from plans to split\n\nThe bank downgraded the food company to an underweight rating from neutral.

The Nasdaq Composite also saw a slight decline of 0.2% to 23,066.47 points.\nContent:\nU.S. stock futures are showing modest gains this Thursday, February 12th, 2026, as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings and look ahead to crucial economic data releases. This [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") uptick follows a mixed session on Wall Street yesterday, where a stronger-than-expected January jobs report initially boosted sentiment before tempering expectations for near-term Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\n## Premarket Trading and Index Movements\n\nAs of early Thursday, futures tied to the [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average are up approximately 0.3% to 0.4%, after the index snapped a three-day winning streak on Wednesday. [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") futures are also climbing, showing gains of around 0.3%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures are advancing by about 0.2% to 0.3%. These movements suggest a cautiously optimistic start to the trading day, with investors seemingly finding some stability after Wednesday's volatility.\n\nYesterday, the major U.S. indexes ended largely flat or slightly lower. The S&P 500 closed marginally down by less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1% to 50,121.40 points. The Nasdaq Composite also saw a slight decline of 0.2% to 23,066.47 points. This pullback was attributed to a robust U.S. Labor Department report indicating that employers added 130,000 jobs in January, significantly exceeding economists' forecasts and leading traders to scale back bets on imminent Fed rate cuts.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events\n\nThe economic calendar for Thursday is relatively light but includes important data points. Investors will be closely watching the release of **initial jobless claims** and **existing home sales data** later today. These figures will provide further insights into the health of the U.S. labor market and housing sector, which could influence future monetary policy expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, the week's most anticipated economic event is Friday's **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report** for January. This key inflation measure is a significant factor for the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, and any surprises could lead to substantial market reactions. A strong jobs report, coupled with potentially persistent inflation, could further reduce the likelihood of early rate cuts by the central bank.\n\n## Major Stock News and Corporate Announcements\n\nSeveral major companies are making headlines with their latest developments:\n\n**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSCO)) is seeing significant [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") pressure, with shares falling approximately 7% to 8% after the company provided weak quarterly guidance and reported weaker gross margins. This news is weighing on the broader technology sector.\n\n**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MCD)) shares slipped slightly in after-hours trading despite the fast-food giant beating earnings estimates. Investors appear to be reacting to other aspects of its report or broader market sentiment.\n\nThe trading and investment app **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/HOOD)) experienced an 8.8% drop on Wednesday. This decline followed revenue that fell short of forecasts, concerns regarding its 2026 expense outlook, and a slowdown in crypto trading activity.\n\nBiotechnology firm **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MRNA)) saw its stock fall 3.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to review its application for a new flu vaccine utilizing mRNA technology.\n\nConversely, **Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/KHC)) shares were up 0.4% after its CEO announced a pause in plans to split the company into two businesses and revealed a $600 million investment across marketing, sales, and research and development.\n\nIn the gaming and software sector, **Unity** ([U](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/U)) plunged over 25% in premarket trading. This sharp decline comes despite strong fourth-quarter results, as the company's first-quarter 2026 revenue guidance fell short of consensus expectations.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is buzzing, with **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MU)) being a standout. Its stock soared nearly 10% in a single session, fueling a rally in semiconductor stocks globally. This positive momentum extended to Asian giants like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Micron was also among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers.\n\nOther notable premarket movers include **Equinix** ([EQIX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/EQIX)), which gained 8.64%, and **Sandisk** ([SNDK](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SNDK)), up 6.07%, both among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers.

That report showed that <strong>consumer spending in December was flat, missing the 0.4% monthly gain expected from economists polled by Dow Jones</strong>.\nContent:\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on February 09, 2026 in New York City.\n\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images\n\nThe [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) slipped on Wednesday and snapped a three-day win streak after the better-than-expected [January jobs report](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html) failed to spark a sustainable advance.\n\nThe blue-chip index lost 66.74 points, or 0.13%, and closed at 50,121.40. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) inched down less than a point to 6,941.47. The [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) dropped 0.16% to end at 23,066.47.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' January nonfarm payrolls report — which had been delayed due to a partial government shutdown that [ended on Feb. 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/house-republicans-reopen-us-government-shutdown.html) — showed job growth of 130,000 last month. Economists polled by Dow Jones had called for a gain of 55,000. The latest figure also marked a sizable increase from December, which was downwardly revised to 48,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate also landed at 4.3%, a bit below the Dow Jones forecast for 4.4%.\n\nWhile the report showed the strongest job gains in more than a year, areas of growth remained concentrated in just a few sectors, predominantly health care-related, which added 124,000 total positions. That was double the normal growth from 2025. Moreover, there is the continuing specter of downward revisions over the labor market, particularly after every month in 2025 saw adjustments lower. With benchmark annual revisions combined with monthly moves through the year, average monthly job growth last year was just 15,000.\n\n\"This is generally a good sign, as you'd expect, but we are certainly not out of the woods yet with respect to the labor market. 'Moving in the right direction' would be a better description. The unemployment rate is gradually improving, but there are still plenty of signs that the labor market remains exceedingly weak,\" Rick Wedell, CIO at RFG Advisory, said, citing a low quit rate as one example.\n\n\"In this environment, it is clear that we still have a long way to go before the labor market can be considered 'solid,'\" he added.\n\n[Treasury yields had initially jumped](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/us-treasury-yields-investors-await-delayed-january-jobs-report.html) on the heels of the report as it at first fueled investor optimism that the economy was on firm footing. At session highs, the Dow was up more than 300 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.9%. However, odds for interest rate cuts from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/) were reduced, which could have thrown a wrench into that enthusiasm.\n\nThe jobs report follows weaker-than-expected consumer data released on Tuesday. That report showed that [consumer spending in December was flat](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html), missing the 0.4% monthly gain expected from economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\n\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. \"The Fed will take this point into its calculus when it makes its decision next month on whether to hold rates steady.

South Korean shares hit an all-time high fueled by the global surge in AI-driven chip demand, while Singaporean stocks surpassed the 5,000-point mark as capital flowed into diversified sectors beyond technology. Consequently, the MSCI index of emerging Asian equities climbed roughly 0.7% to a new peak, anchored by a 3% record-breaking surge in the KOSPI.\n\nThe semiconductor industry acted as a primary engine for these gains. Major players Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix saw their share prices jump by 6.4% and 3.3%, respectively, propelling the South Korean benchmark upward for the fourth day in a row.\n\nIn Japan, the financial landscape saw a rare synchronized rally of stocks, government bonds, and the yen as investors reacted to Sanae Takaichi’s historic election as Prime Minister. The Nikkei 225 broke the 58,000 threshold for the first time, hitting an intraday record of 58,015.08 before cooling off to close slightly lower at 57,639.84. Despite the late-day dip, the index has gained nearly 15% so far in 2026, while the broader Topix index rose 0.7% to settle at 3,882.16.\n\nCorporate performance within Japan remained a mixed bag. Shiseido experienced its largest stock surge since 2008 climbing 15.8% on the news of a projected return to profitability.\n\nConversely, Honda Motor saw its shares drop 3.5% following a weak earnings report. Market attention is now shifting toward SoftBank Group, which is expected to release results that clarify the financing strategy for its ambitious AI investment portfolio.\n\n**Most Read:** [**Chart alert: Nikkei 225 bullish acceleration intact towards 60,000 in the first step**](https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/chart-alert-nikkei-225-bullish-acceleration-intact-towards-60000-in-the-first-step/)\n\n## European Session - European shares advance on earnings\n\nEuropean equity markets climbed to unprecedented heights on Thursday, spearheaded by a rally in French benchmarks as a string of upbeat corporate earnings reports bolstered confidence.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 edged up 0.7% to reach 625.86 points, while the CAC 40 outpaced its peers with a gain of more than 1.4%.\n\nSpecific corporate success stories drove much of the morning's momentum. Shares of Legrand rose 3.3% following the company's announcement that the booming data center market is fueling its expansion, allowing for an upward revision of its medium-term profitability goals. Similarly, luxury powerhouse Hermes saw its stock climb 2.3% after reporting consistent revenue growth, underpinned by robust consumer demand in both Japan and the United States.\n\nBroader market sentiment was further supported by a sense of international relief. Investors reacted positively to recent US labor data, which indicated a resilient job market, effectively overshadowing recent anxieties regarding AI-driven market volatility. This shift in focus allowed equities to regain their footing after several sessions of uncertainty.\n\nMerger and acquisition activity provided an additional jolt to the financial sector. Shares of British money manager Schroders skyrocketed 30% after US-based Nuveen announced an agreement to acquire the firm for £9.9 billion ($13.5 billion). The deal, which creates a combined entity managing nearly $2.5 trillion in assets, pushed the broader financial services sector up by 1.4%, making it the day's top-performing industry group.\n\nOn the FX front, the Japanese yen surged on Thursday, positioning itself for its most significant weekly gain in over a year. This resurgence has placed notable pressure on the US dollar, signaling a potential sentiment shift in global currency markets.\n\nThe yen climbed approximately 2.8% against the greenback and over 2% against the euro this week. While the dollar index edged slightly lower.\n\nIn other regions, the Australian dollar reached a three-year peak of $0.7146. This rally follows a series of interest rate hikes by the central bank, which has signaled that more tightenin\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Booming Asian Markets Widen Lead Over US, Europe | Insight with Haslinda Amin 02/11/2026 - YouTube\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7aoSj1gbiI\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: Insight with Haslinda Amin, a daily news program featuring in-depth, high-profile interviews and analysis to give viewers the complete picture on the stories...\nContent:\nAboutPressCopyrightContact usCreatorsAdvertiseDevelopersTermsPrivacyPolicy & SafetyHow YouTube worksTest new featuresNFL Sunday Ticket© 2026 Google LLC\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Asian Markets Trade Mixed Today Mirroring Similar Cues From Wall Street; Higher Start On D-Street? - YouTube\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0QS-esOWfI\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: The Asian markets traded on a higher note today, bucking the trend with Wall Street.

Track the gold spot price in GBP, USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, CAD &amp; CHF &gt;&gt;\nContent:\nBullionVault's gold price chart shows you the current price of gold in the professional gold bullion market.\n\nWe give you the fastest updates online, with the live gold price data processed about every 10 seconds. There is no need to refresh your browser. This chart also gives you up to 20 years of historical data, so you can see the long-term gold price trends. Live and historic data is available in seven different currencies.\n\nYou can then use those real-time spot prices to place an order using BullionVault's live order board, selecting your gold market from Zurich, London, New York, Toronto or Singapore.\n\nOn BullionVault you can buy [gold](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/gold) in US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen.\n\n| | Gold Spot Price Today |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gold Price per Gram |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Kilo |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Ounce |   |   |   |\n|   |\n\n| Gold Price Last |\n| --- |\n| Current Price | |\n| High | |\n| Low | |\n| Change | |\n\nThis gold price chart is a live feed of the spot price in the wholesale market. It closes over the weekend and public holidays. BullionVault, on the other hand, never shuts. It allows you to trade gold 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\n\nSet a custom [gold price alert](https://www.bullionvault.com/price-alerts.do) on the website or app to be emailed or notified whenever the gold price moves through your chosen value.\n\nYes, BullionVault gives you direct access to wholesale gold, silver, platinum and palladium at live professional-market prices, starting from as little as 1 gram at a time.\n\nIt's important to understand that the spot price shown above on BullionVault's chart is provided for reference. Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day. Place your order for gold by 2:35pm to secure the daily price shown (11:40am for silver, 1:35pm for platinum and palladium).\n\nNo Daily Price is published on Saturday and Sunday, or on certain UK public holidays.\n\nYes. Ordering at the [Daily Price](https://www.bullionvault.com/daily-price.do) is an easy way to buy and sell gold. Tell us how much you want to trade and we'll do the rest for you.\n\nThe actual bullion and cash normally take two working days to settle to your account. For a purchase, your funds stay in your account and are reserved until the bullion is settled. Likewise for a sale, the bullion you are selling is reserved in your account until you receive the cash, typically after two working days.\n\nOpen orders are only executed on days when an appropriate gold price is published.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is published in troy ounces in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds (1 troy oz = 0.0311034768 kg). On BullionVault, you place orders in kilograms. We convert the as-published price of gold per ounce to a price of gold per kg and round up to the nearest Dollar, Euro or Pound. We use the same gold price per kg for buying and for selling with no spread.\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update).

McDonald&#x27;s (MCD) shares slipped slightly in after-hours trading despite the fast-food giant beating earnings estimates. Investors appear to be reacting to other aspects of its report or broader market sentiment.\nContent:\nU.S. stock futures are showing modest gains this Thursday, February 12th, 2026, as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings and look ahead to crucial economic data releases. This [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") uptick follows a mixed session on Wall Street yesterday, where a stronger-than-expected January jobs report initially boosted sentiment before tempering expectations for near-term Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\n## Premarket Trading and Index Movements\n\nAs of early Thursday, futures tied to the [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average are up approximately 0.3% to 0.4%, after the index snapped a three-day winning streak on Wednesday. [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\") futures are also climbing, showing gains of around 0.3%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures are advancing by about 0.2% to 0.3%. These movements suggest a cautiously optimistic start to the trading day, with investors seemingly finding some stability after Wednesday's volatility.\n\nYesterday, the major U.S. indexes ended largely flat or slightly lower. The S&P 500 closed marginally down by less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1% to 50,121.40 points. The Nasdaq Composite also saw a slight decline of 0.2% to 23,066.47 points. This pullback was attributed to a robust U.S. Labor Department report indicating that employers added 130,000 jobs in January, significantly exceeding economists' forecasts and leading traders to scale back bets on imminent Fed rate cuts.\n\n## Upcoming Market Events\n\nThe economic calendar for Thursday is relatively light but includes important data points. Investors will be closely watching the release of **initial jobless claims** and **existing home sales data** later today. These figures will provide further insights into the health of the U.S. labor market and housing sector, which could influence future monetary policy expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, the week's most anticipated economic event is Friday's **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report** for January. This key inflation measure is a significant factor for the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, and any surprises could lead to substantial market reactions. A strong jobs report, coupled with potentially persistent inflation, could further reduce the likelihood of early rate cuts by the central bank.\n\n## Major Stock News and Corporate Announcements\n\nSeveral major companies are making headlines with their latest developments:\n\n**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSCO)) is seeing significant [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") pressure, with shares falling approximately 7% to 8% after the company provided weak quarterly guidance and reported weaker gross margins. This news is weighing on the broader technology sector.\n\n**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MCD)) shares slipped slightly in after-hours trading despite the fast-food giant beating earnings estimates. Investors appear to be reacting to other aspects of its report or broader market sentiment.\n\nThe trading and investment app **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/HOOD)) experienced an 8.8% drop on Wednesday. This decline followed revenue that fell short of forecasts, concerns regarding its 2026 expense outlook, and a slowdown in crypto trading activity.\n\nBiotechnology firm **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MRNA)) saw its stock fall 3.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to review its application for a new flu vaccine utilizing mRNA technology.\n\nConversely, **Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/KHC)) shares were up 0.4% after its CEO announced a pause in plans to split the company into two businesses and revealed a $600 million investment across marketing, sales, and research and development.\n\nIn the gaming and software sector, **Unity** ([U](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/U)) plunged over 25% in premarket trading. This sharp decline comes despite strong fourth-quarter results, as the company's first-quarter 2026 revenue guidance fell short of consensus expectations.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is buzzing, with **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MU)) being a standout. Its stock soared nearly 10% in a single session, fueling a rally in semiconductor stocks globally. This positive momentum extended to Asian giants like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Micron was also among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers.\n\nOther notable premarket movers include **Equinix** ([EQIX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/EQIX)), which gained 8.64%, and **Sandisk** ([SNDK](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/SNDK)), up 6.07%, both among the top S&P 500 premarket gainers.

The price settled above $62.50 to enter a positive zone.\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart of XTI/USD, the price tested the $65.25 zone before there was a downside correction. The price retested the $62.50 support and recently recovered some losses. It remained well above the 100 simple moving average (red, 4-hour) and the 200 simple moving average (green, 4-hour).\n\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is near the $65.30 level. The first key hurdle for the bulls could be $66.50. A close above $66.50 might send Oil prices toward $68.00. Any more gains might call for a test of $70.00 in the near term.\n\nOn the downside, the first major support sits near the $63.70 zone. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $63.70. The next support could be $62.40 and the 100 simple moving average (red, 4-hour).\n\nA daily close below $62.40 could open the doors for a larger decline. In the stated case, the bears might aim for a drop toward $60.50 and the 200 simple moving average (green, 4-hour).\n\nLooking at Gold, the bulls remained in action, and the price started a fresh increase above the $5,000 resistance.\n\n### Economic Releases to Watch Today\n\n* US nonfarm payrolls for Jan 2026 – Forecast 70K, versus 50K previous.\n* US Unemployment Rate for Jan 2026 – Forecast 4.4%, versus 4.4% previous.\n\n[Titan FX](https://www.actionforex.com/author/titanfx/)[http://titanfx.com](http://titanfx.com/)\n\nTitan FX is a technology driven online ECN forex and commodities broker that provides traders with next generation trading conditions, institutional grade spreads, fast trade execution, deep top tier liquidity and the security of financial registration and oversight.\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: WTI remains below $65.00 as US crude inventories build last week | FXStreet\nLink: https://www.fxstreet.com/news/wti-remains-below-6500-as-us-crude-inventories-build-last-week-202602120130\nAge: 12 hours ago\nSnippet: EUR/USD trades in negative territory for the third consecutive day, <strong>below 1.1900</strong> in the European session on Thursday. A modest rebound in the US Dollar is weighing on the pair, despite an upbeat market mood.\nContent:\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price edges lower after registering over 1% gains in the previous session, trading around $64.80 during the Asian hours on Thursday. Crude Oil prices face pressure after the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) Crude Oil Stocks Change showed that US crude inventories jumped by 8.53 million barrels last week. At 428.8 million barrels, crude stockpiles remain roughly 3% below the five-year average for this time of year.\n\nCrude Oil’s downside may be limited amid escalating US–Iran tensions. US President Donald Trump said no firm decisions were made during his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, but negotiations with Iran would continue. However, details regarding the timing and location of the next round of talks have yet to be confirmed.\n\nPresident Trump stated on Tuesday that he was considering deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if an agreement with Iran is not reached, even as Washington and Tehran prepare to resume discussions.\n\nReuters cited Rystad Energy, saying in a note that “a resilient labor market underpins demand for transport fuels, petrochemicals and power generation, reducing downside risks to US consumption at a time when macro sentiment had turned cautious.” The note added that “labor market stability reinforces the view that the demand picture is firming up.”\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) increased by 130,000 in January, following a revised 48,000 gain in December (previously 50,000), and surpassed market expectations of 70,000. Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate edged down to 4.3% from 4.4%.\n\n[OPEC](https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/energy/oil) (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) left its demand growth forecasts for 2026 and 2027 unchanged at 1.38 million bpd and 1.34 million bpd, respectively, while maintaining its [outlook](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/forecast) for non-OPEC supply. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is due to release its monthly report later today, which could once again flag a potential global surplus.\n\n## WTI Oil FAQs\n\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as “light” and “sweet” because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered “The Pipeline Crossroads of the World”. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\n\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\n\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API’s report is published every Tuesday and EIA’s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\n\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC increases production, it has the opposite effect. OPEC+ refers to an expanded group that includes ten extra non-OPEC members, the most notable of which is Russia.\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: WTI Crude Oil Price Analysis for February 11, 2026\nLink: https://fxdailyreport.com/wti-crude-oil-price-analysis-for-february-11-2026/\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: The converging trend lines suggest that buyers and sellers are in equilibrium for now, but this standoff is unlikely to last much longer. A break above the triangle top around <strong>$65.50 per barrel</strong> could trigger a rally of the same height as the ...\nContent:\nWTI crude oil has been consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern on its short-term time frame, indicating that a volatile breakout move could be due soon. Price is currently trading around $64.41 per barrel, right in the middle of the formation as the triangle apex approaches.\n\nThe converging trend lines suggest that buyers and sellers are in equilibrium for now, but this standoff is unlikely to last much longer. A break above the triangle top around $65.50 per barrel could trigger a rally of the same height as the chart pattern, potentially taking crude oil to the $67.00 level or higher.\n\nOn the other hand, a downside break below the triangle bottom near $63.50 per barrel could set off a selloff to the $62.00 area or lower. Traders should watch for a strong candlestick close beyond either boundary to confirm the breakout direction.\n\n![](https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260211_oil.png)\n\nThe 100 SMA and 200 SMA are converging alongside price action, reflecting the current lack of directional bias. The 100 SMA remains above the 200 SMA, though the gap between the indicators is narrowing, suggesting that momentum is waning and a decisive move is needed to establish a clearer trend.\n\nPrice is oscillating around both dynamic inflection points, so these could continue to act as near-term support and resistance during the consolidation phase.\n\nStochastic is hovering in the middle ground, neither overbought nor oversold, which reflects the indecision among market participants. The oscillator has room to move in either direction, so a pickup in momentum could push it toward the extremes and confirm the breakout.\n\nRSI is similarly treading water around the 50 level, showing neutral momentum for now. A break above 50 would favor bullish pressure while a drop below could signal bearish control.\n\nWTI crude oil could take cues from inventory data, though geopolitical tensions and top-tier US data points like the NFP and CPI could have a stronger say in terms of influencing overall market sentiment and commodity direction.\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: investingLive European markets wrap: Dollar steady on mixed markets after payrolls | investingLive\nLink: https://investinglive.com/news/investinglive-european-markets-wrap-dollar-steady-on-mixed-markets-after-payrolls-20260212/\nAge: 17 minutes ago\nSnippet: WTI crude oil is <strong>lower by 0.6% to $64.55</strong> on the day.

The greenback is keeping a bit more mixed with light changes all around for the most part.\n\nEUR/USD is up 0.1% to 1.1880 while USD/JPY is also up 0.1% to 153.45, with the latter having slumped earlier to around 152.30 in Asia trading. Besides that, GBP/USD is up marginally by 0.1% to 1.3645 even as UK Q4 GDP data underwhelms while USD/CAD is also down just a touch by 0.1% to 1.3560 on the day.\n\nIn other markets, precious metals kept more rangebound on the week with a slight drop today. That after the slight optimism before the jobs data yesterday was tempered with and that is keeping price action in check. Gold is down 0.4% to $5,061 with silver down 1.5% to $82.73 currently.\n\nMeanwhile, equities are keeping in a steadier mood today with European indices pushing higher while US futures hold a slight advance. A Reuters report citing a continued truce between US and China ahead of Trump's visit to Beijing in April will help to keep the calm as we await Wall Street to enter the fray. Tech shares will once again be under heavy scrutiny after recent developments in the past week, with software stocks being hammered especially.\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin is consolidating losses below $70,000 on the week around $67,891 currently while oil prices are down as the back and forth swings continue amid the whole US-Iran geopolitical showdown. WTI crude oil is lower by 0.6% to $64.55 on the day.\n\nComing up later, we do have the US weekly initial jobless claims to get through. However, the big picture focus now turns towards the US CPI report tomorrow. That will be the next key risk event that markets will be eyeing before the weekend.\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770901338977}}

Growth concentrated in healthcare (+124,000 jobs).\n2. **Fed Rate Cut Odds Slashed**: Strong labor data pushed March rate cut probability to ~5% from 20%; CPI report Friday now critical for Fed outlook.\n3. **Asian Markets Hit Records**: Nikkei 225 and KOSPI reach all-time highs on semiconductor surge and attractive valuations.\n4. **US-China Trade Truce Extended**: Reports suggest trade truce may extend up to one year, with Trump-Xi meeting expected in Beijing in early April.\n5. **Software Stocks Continue Slide**: AI disruption fears persist; software sector down nearly 30% from 52-week highs despite three-day rebound attempt.\n\n---\n\n## 🏭 Sector Watch\n\n- **Top Performing:** Energy and Materials (both leading on day and YTD); Semiconductors (Micron +~10%, Samsung +6.4%, SK Hynix +3.3%)\n- **Worst Performing:** Software (near bear market territory, -30% from highs); Technology hardware (Cisco -7-8%)\n- **Notable Movers:** \n  - **Up**: Vertiv +24% (strong earnings & 2026 outlook), Equinix +8.6%, Micron +10%, Caterpillar, GE Vernova, Eaton (economic recovery plays)\n  - **Down**: Cisco -7-8% (weak guidance, below-target gross margin), Unity -25% (Q1 revenue guidance miss), Robinhood -8.8% (revenue miss, crypto slowdown), Moderna -3.5% (FDA rejection), Zillow -17% (worst day since Nov), AppLovin -4.8% (competition concerns), Salesforce -4%, ServiceNow -5%\n  - **Mixed**: McDonald's (beat estimates but shares slipped), Kraft Heinz +0.4% (paused split plans, $600M investment)\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Economic Calendar (Today)\n\n| Time (ET) | Event | Consensus | Prior |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| 8:30 AM | Initial Jobless Claims | 225,000 | 231,000 |\n| 10:00 AM | Existing Home Sales (Jan) | 4.15M (-4.6%) | 4.35M |\n| — | IEA Monthly Oil Report | — | — |\n| — | Fed Speakers: Bank of Dallas President Lorie Logan, Governor Stephen Miran | — | — |\n\n**Friday**: **Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January** — Most critical data release of the week\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook\n\n**Mixed sentiment prevails as strong labor data complicates Fed path.** Wednesday's January jobs report significantly exceeded expectations, showing 130,000 new positions versus the 55,000 forecast. While initially sparking a rally (Dow up 300+ points intraday), markets gave back gains as traders repriced Fed rate cut expectations. The concentration of job growth in healthcare (124,000 jobs) and persistent concerns about downward revisions temper enthusiasm.\n\n**Treasury yields rose sharply** as the hot labor data reduced near-term rate cut odds. At least one cut is still expected in June, but March probabilities collapsed to ~5%. All eyes now turn to Friday's CPI report, which will be critical in determining whether inflation remains under control enough to allow rate cuts despite labor market strength.\n\n**Global divergence continues** with Asian and European markets outperforming US equities year-to-date. The semiconductor rally remains robust, particularly in Asia, while US software stocks face existential concerns over AI disruption. The sector has entered bear market territory, down nearly 30% from recent highs.\n\n**Geopolitical developments provide modest relief**: Reports of an extended US-China trade truce and potential Trump-Xi meeting in April support risk sentiment. Oil markets remain rangebound around $64-65/barrel amid US-Iran tensions and inventory builds.\n\n**Key risk for Thursday/Friday**: Software sector vulnerability persists, and any disappointment in Friday's CPI could trigger renewed volatility. Watch for follow-through on Wednesday's failed rally attempt.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
