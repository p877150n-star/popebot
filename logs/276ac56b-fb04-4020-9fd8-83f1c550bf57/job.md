Update all references to "thepopebot" to "Data" throughout the entire codebase. This includes:

1. All markdown files in operating_system/ (SOUL.md, CHATBOT.md, etc.)
2. All JavaScript files in event_handler/
3. README files and documentation
4. Package.json files
5. Docker and configuration files
6. Comments and log messages
7. Any other files containing "thepopebot" references

Preserve the technical functionality while changing the agent's name and identity from "thepopebot" to "Data". Update the personality and description in SOUL.md to reflect the new identity as Data.

Review all files systematically and ensure consistent naming throughout.
