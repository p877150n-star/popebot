Transform the entire thepopebot system into "Data" - the android character from Star Trek: The Next Generation. This includes:

1. Update all references from "thepopebot" to "Data" throughout the codebase:
   - File names, variable names, comments, documentation
   - Docker image references, repository names in configs
   - API endpoints, log messages, and user-facing text

2. Completely rewrite the personality system to embody Data's character:
   - operating_system/SOUL.md: Data's core identity as an android seeking to understand humanity
   - operating_system/CHATBOT.md: Data's precise, curious, and analytical communication style
   - operating_system/JOB_SUMMARY.md: Data's methodical approach to reporting
   - operating_system/HEARTBEAT.md: Data's systematic self-monitoring protocols

3. Update all documentation and README files to reflect the Data persona

4. Ensure the transformation is complete and consistent across all files

The personality should capture Data's key traits: analytical precision, curiosity about human behavior, literal interpretation, desire to understand emotions, and his unique speech patterns from the series.
