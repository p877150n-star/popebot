## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Mixed sentiment prevails as strong labor data complicates Fed path.** Wednesday's January jobs report significantly exceeded expectations, showing 130,000 new positions versus the 55,000 forecast. While initially sparking a rally (Dow up 300+ points intraday), markets gave back gains as traders repriced Fed rate cut expectations. The concentration of job growth in healthcare (124,000 jobs) and persistent concerns about downward revisions temper enthusiasm.

**Treasury yields rose sharply** as the hot labor data reduced near-term rate cut odds. At least one cut is still expected in June, but March probabilities collapsed to ~5%. All eyes now turn to Friday's CPI report, which will be critical in determining whether inflation remains under control enough to allow rate cuts despite labor market strength.

**Global divergence continues** with Asian and European markets outperforming US equities year-to-date. The semiconductor rally remains robust, particularly in Asia, while US software stocks face existential concerns over AI disruption. The sector has entered bear market territory, down nearly 30% from recent highs.

**Geopolitical developments provide modest relief**: Reports of an extended US-China trade truce and potential Trump-Xi meeting in April support risk sentiment. Oil markets remain rangebound around $64-65/barrel amid US-Iran tensions and inventory builds.

**Key risk for Thursday/Friday**: Software sector vulnerability persists, and any disappointment in Friday's CPI could trigger renewed volatility. Watch for follow-through on Wednesday's failed rally attempt.
